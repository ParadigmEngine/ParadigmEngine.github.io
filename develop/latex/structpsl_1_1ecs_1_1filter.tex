tag allows you to filter on sets of components  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$selectors.\+hpp$>$}



\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$typename... Ts$>$\newline
struct psl\+::ecs\+::filter$<$ Ts $>$}

When you just want to create a generic filtering behaviour, without getting the components themselves, then you can use this tag to mark those requested components. \textbackslash{}warn tags do not mean this component will be present in the pack, they are considered filter directives (or specialized filter directives).
