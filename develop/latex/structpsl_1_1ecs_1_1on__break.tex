Similarly to the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structpsl_1_1ecs_1_1on__combine}{on\+\_\+combine}}} tag, the \mbox{\hyperlink{structpsl_1_1ecs_1_1on__break}{on\+\_\+break}} that denotes a combination group, but instead of containing all recently combined components, it instead contains all those who recently broke connection. This can be ideal to use in a system (such as a render system), to erase draw calls. \textbackslash{}warn tags do not mean this component will be present in the pack, they are considered filter directives (or specialized filter directives).
